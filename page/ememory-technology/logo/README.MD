## About eMemory Technology

eMemory Technology Inc. researches, develops, manufactures, and sells flash memory integrated circuits (IC), embedded flash memory IC IP, memory card output/input controllers, and memory card and digital film related products. The company offers NeoBit, a programmable logic device that embeds into various CMOS processes, including logic, mixed-mode, bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD), analog, radio frequency (RF), and high-voltage (HV); and NeoFuse, a small-form-factor logic non-volatile storage functions for use in IDs, production record, encryption code, and ROM replacement, as well as analog trimming, function selection, and parameter setting applications. Its NeoFuse is also used in set-top boxes, digital TV, CMOS imaging sensors, application and baseband processors, LCD drivers, and power management ICs. The company also provides NeoEE, a single-poly embedded memory device for application in users' preference setting in IC cards, code storage in MCUs and RFICs, configuration settings in NFC controllers, fuse devices in memory redundancy designs, and parameter trimming for analog/RF/HV/BCD circuits; NeoMTP, a single-poly embedded memory technology for USB type-C, wireless charger, touch panels, P-Gamma, MCUs, etc.; and EcoBit, an embedded logic multiple-time programmable solution for passive RFID tags, lower power sensors, battery-saving mobile ICs, and other IoT chips. In addition, it offers NeoPUF, a hardware security technology device for Internet of Things applications; PUF-based solutions; ReRAM, an embedded EEPROM/flash; Green Platform for code storage in microcontrollers or speech ICs; and MagnaChip EEPROM, an IP block device for code storage in micro-controllers and RFICs, and parameter trimming for analog/RF/HV circuits. The company serves semiconductor foundries, integrated devices manufacturers, and fabless design houses in Taiwan and internationally. eMemory Technology Inc. was incorporated in 2000 and is headquartered in Jhubei City, Taiwan.
