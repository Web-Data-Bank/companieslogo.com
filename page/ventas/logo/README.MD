## About Ventas

Ventas, an S&P 500 company, operates at the intersection of two powerful and dynamic industries ¬ñ healthcare and real estate. As one of the world's foremost Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT), we use the power of capital to unlock the value of real estate, partnering with leading care providers, developers, research and medical institutions, innovators and healthcare organizations whose success is buoyed by the demographic tailwind of an aging population.
